    This works in conjunction with the "This project builds a Subversion feature branch" checkbox above.
    This build step merges any revisions in the upstream branch, via <tt>svn merge</tt>, and
    commits them. This is normally called <b>rebasing</b> in Subversion.
    Automatic rebasing is useful to keep branches close to the upstream, thereby reducing
    the risk of integration problem down the road.

    <p>
    You can rebase from the latest revision in the upstream branch, but you can
    also do safer rebase by choosing the permalink. For example, if you specify "last stable",
    then Jenkins will look for the last stable build, then rebase with the corresponding
    Subversion revision. Thus you know that you are rebasing to the known good state.

    <p>
    If you don't want Jenkins to automatically rebase, you can still use the "Rebase From Upstream" link
    from the left to manually initiate the rebase.
